# ADR Ltd Website
#### Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This site is built to complete the first part of the Full Stack Developer course. The website is a modernisation of the company's existing website (which has subsequently been replaced with most of the features built for this project).  The company is a Heating and Plumbing business which offers a range of services to domestic customers.
The purpose of the site is to provide information about the company, its services and also important legal, professional and safety information.

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, having key imformation such as contact information available when users land on the site, and also taking into consideration the typical demographic of potential site user through its simplistc design. 
The color scheme was chosen by the Company Director and aligns to the company's current branding.  The approach used regarding the use of the various colours is intended to give the site a modern look and feel.

## Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
Bootstrap (4.3.1)
Font Awesome (5.10.1)
JQuery (3.3.1)

## Features
This site uses the following features:
The navbar exapnds or collapses depending on device/screen size used. This is achieved using Bootstrap and JQuery.
# scroll to top function?????

A downloadable template document, as an example of a service the company offers, can be found on pages "Appliance Safety" and "Servicing in Detail". 

### Features That Could Be Added
Consideration is being given as to whether a "Contact Us" form should be included that will allow site users to message the company directly from the website.

## Testing
#### Approach
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) using ?????? and on multiple mobile devices (Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5/SE, 6/7/8 and 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad and iPad Pro) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 

#### Issue resolution
During the testing phase, I found and resolved the following issues:
- realized that background-attachment: fixed was not compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photos appeared zoomed-in and blurry. To fix this, the background-attachment: scroll property value was added in a media query.


Social Media links will not open respective site pages as the company does not in fact have any. They will however open a new, social media platform home page as demonstration of the intended functionality.  


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch and located here https://littlemonkee.github.io/ADR-website/. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.


## Credits
### Content
Content on all web pages apart from the page "Terms" was written by the Company Direcctor. Content on the "Terms" page was written by the company'y solicitor. The downloadable form was designed by the Company Director and created as a document by me.
