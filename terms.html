                <p>2.3 Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall prejudice any condition or warranty, express or implied, or any legal remedy to which the Supplier may be entitled in relation to the Goods and Services, by virtue of any statute, law or regulation.</p>
                <p>2.4 Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall affect the Client's statutory rights as a Consumer, if applicable.</p>

                <p>8.4 In addition to the Client's statutory rights, the Supplier guarantees all goods against faulty workmanship and materials for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery unless caused by negligence, wilful misuse or acts of vandalism by the Client or his visitors.</p>

                <p>11.1 Neither the Client nor the Supplier shall be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of their obligations if the delay or failure results from events or circumstances outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, lock outs, accidents, terrorism, war, fire, breakdown of plant or machinery or shortage or unavailability of raw materials from a natural source of supply, and the party shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of its obligations.</p>
